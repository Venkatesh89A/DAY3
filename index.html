<h3>Topic about Github</h3>
<p>GitHub is a web-based platform that uses Git to host and manage code for version control, 
collaboration, and project management. It provides a place for developers to store their code in "repositories,"
track changes, and work together on projects by sharing code and tracking issues. </p>
